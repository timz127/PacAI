## Pacman

My code are inside pacai/student

A modified version of the Pacman educational project from the [Berkeley AI Lab](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html).

Some improvements from the original project:
 - Upgraded to Python 3.
 - Organized into packages.
 - Brought up to a common style with a style checker.
 - Added logging.
 - Added tests.
 - Fixed several bugs.
 - Generalized and reorganized several project elements.
 - Replaced the graphics systems.
 - Added the ability to generate gifs from any pacman or capture game.
